Todo:
Currently all the front end can do is send in the post requests. We still need to be able to display the processed image and obtain and display the histograms (both will require changes on the backend). Refer to my comments on line 30 in ImageProcessor.js

To be able to run App.js, be sure to install by the following packages by typing:

```
$ npm install material-ui@next
```
and
```
$ npm install react-dropzone-component
```
and
```
$ npm install @ navjobs/upload
```
into the command line.
